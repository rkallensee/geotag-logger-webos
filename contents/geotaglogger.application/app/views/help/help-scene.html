                            <strong>Sorry, what's geo-tagging?</strong><br />
                            Geotagging of pictures just means to store the (more or less exact) position
                            where the picture was taken
                            as metadata into your pictures. This allows you to do interesting stuff with
                            the help of photo-applications: display your images on a world-map, see where
                            you took the pictures a few years later and so on. Flickr, for example, can
                            show a small map next to the image if your pictures are geo-tagged and you
                            activated the respective option.<br />
                            The pictures from your WebOS phone camera can be easily geo-tagged automatically
                            by turning on the option in the phone settings. But for (dedicated) photo cameras
                            without a GPS sensor, it's a bit more complicated. This is where "Geotag logger"
                            kicks in.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>What is "Geotag logger"?</strong><br />
                            This application was designed to help with geo-tagging images from an external
                            camera, e.g. your DSLR camera. There are external devices you can buy to track
                            your position and afterwards "merge" the geo-coordinates into your pictures. But
                            since you own a WebOS device with a GPS sensor, you can just
                            use it to log your position with this tiny application. Afterwards you can use
                            <a href="http://geotag.sourceforge.net/">Geotag</a>,
                            <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gpicsync/">GPicSync</a> or another
                            existing free and open-source software to include the geo-information from the GPX
                            file you exported from this application into your pictures. The desktop application
                            matches the time from your position log and your photos, so you should set your
                            WebOS device clock to the correct time as well as your camera clock.
                            <br />
                            To sum up: Basically this application just tracks your position and provides you a
                            GPX file which you can use to tag your photos with a third-party desktop application.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Tracking.</strong><br />
                            If you just take a few photos here and there, it should be perfectly ok to just hit "Record single
                            trackpoint" before/after you took the photo. If you are moving a lot and take a lot of
                            photos, you should possibly activate "Record continuous". While this mode is active (visible by the
                            spinner in the right edge of the button), the application tracks your position every five minutes.
                            While this might drain your battery a bit more, it's also a lot more convenient since you don't
                            have to remember to track your position every few minutes. Just hit the button a second time to
                            stop the continuous tracking. Be aware that the position might be inaccurate when you activated
                            continuous tracking and you keep your device in a bag or your position doesn't allow accurate
                            tracking, e.g. in buildings.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Export.</strong><br />
                            After tracking your position and shooting a lot of photos, you're back to your desktop computer,
                            editing your photos and you now want to geo-tag them. You just have to export the data stored in
                            your phone by using the application menu. Select "Export GPX" and then select the GPX version.
                            In most of the cases it should be fine to take "GPX v1.1" since it's the current GPX version. Older
                            applications might be picky and just support the older format - so if you get into trouble with
                            the 1.1 version, just try "GPX v1.0". After you get the confirmation that your data was saved, you
                            can attach your WebOS device to your computer. On the USB partition you now find a new folder named
                            "geotag-logger". In this folder you can find all your exported GPX files and copy or move them
                            to your desktop computer.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>Clear database.</strong><br />
                            If you exported your tracks and geo-tagged your photos, you should clean up. Just select
                            "Clear database" from the application menu. This empties the tracking database of your application,
                            but of course it doesn't delete exported GPX files on your USB partition. So you can start with a
                            fresh database the next time you're going out to take photos.
                            <br /><br />
                            <strong>View your tracks on the go.</strong><br />
                            If you want to show your tracks on your WebOS device, you can use the free application
                            <a href="http://developer.palm.com/appredirect/?packageid=com.rustyapps.gpxmapper">GPX Mapper</a>
                            from the App Catalog. Just export a GPX file and then open it with "GPX Mapper". It displays your
                            tracks as a Google Maps overlay.
                            <br /><br />
